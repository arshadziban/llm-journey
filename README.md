# ðŸ§  llm-journey

Welcome to **llm-journey** â€” my personal deep dive into the world of **Transformers** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This repository documents my learning journey, experiments, and practical implementations as I explore cutting-edge models such as **BERT**, **GPT**, **T5**, and beyond.

## ðŸš€ About the Project

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with transformer-based models and understand how they power natural language understanding and generation tasks. This repository contains:

- ðŸ”¬ **Code implementations** of famous transformer architectures
- ðŸ§ª **Experiments** on text classification, summarization, translation, and more
- ðŸ“š **Study notes** and visualizations to solidify theoretical knowledge
- ðŸ“ˆ Performance analysis and evaluation metrics
